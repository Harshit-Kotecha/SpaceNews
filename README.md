# JetNews App - Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a simple space news app built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. The primary goal of this project was to learn and explore different technologies and libraries commonly used in modern Android development.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for creating the user interface in a modern, declarative way.
- **Retrofit**: For making network requests to fetch news data from an API.
- **OkHttpClient**: As the HTTP client for handling network operations.
- **Hilt**: For dependency injection, making the code more modular and testable.
- **Coroutines**: To handle asynchronous operations, such as network requests, smoothly.
- **ViewModels**: For managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Clean Architecture**: Organized the code in layers to separate concerns and make it more maintainable.

## How It Works

1. **UI Layer**: Built with Jetpack Compose, displaying a list of news articles.
2. **Data Layer**: Uses Retrofit and OkHttpClient to fetch data from a news API.
3. **Dependency Injection**: Hilt is used to provide dependencies across the app.
4. **Asynchronous Operations**: Coroutines ensure smooth and responsive user interactions by handling background tasks.
5. **Architecture**: The app is structured following Clean Architecture principles to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project to download all dependencies.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how to create modern Android UIs using Jetpack Compose.
- Gaining experience with making network requests using Retrofit and OkHttpClient.
- Learning how to use Hilt for dependency injection.
- Exploring how to manage app state and lifecycle with ViewModels and Coroutines.
- Practicing Clean Architecture to structure code effectively.

## Conclusion

This project was a great way to dive into some of the latest tools and practices in Android development. While it is a simple app, the knowledge gained from building it is valuable for more complex projects in the future.
